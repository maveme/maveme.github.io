I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at [VU Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl/). Using my background in software engineering, I founded the [Sports Intelligence Lab](https://sportsintelligencelab.com), a research lab focused on the intersection of sports and technology. My research interests also include the conservation of software-based artworks, creative coding, and end-user programming.

I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/). Previously, I worked as an Instructor at [Universidad de Los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co) (Bogotá, Colombia), where I obtained my BSc and MSc degrees.
