abstract: Interactive notebooks allow people to communicate and collaborate through a single rich document that might include live code, multimedia, computed results, and documentation, which is persisted as a whole for reproducibility. Notebooks are currently being used extensively in domains such as data science, data journalism, and machine learning. However, constructing a notebook interface for a new language requires a lot of effort. In this tool paper, we present Bacat치, a language parametric notebook generator for domain-specific languages (DSL) based on the Jupyter framework. Bacat치 is designed so that language engineers may reuse existing language components (such as parsers, code generators, interpreters, etc.) as much as possible. Moreover, we explain the design of Bacat치 and how DSL notebooks can be generated with minimum effort in the context of the Rascal meta programming system and language workbench.
