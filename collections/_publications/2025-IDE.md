  Block-based programming environments have become widely recognized as a user-friendly approach to programming, especially for beginners and non-technical users. They offer a programming experience based on the what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) paradigm.
  These environments employ visual jigsaw-like blocks that users can snap together to form programs, allowing them to focus on logical concepts without the burden of the language's syntax.
  However, the usability of these environments often varies, affecting the quality of the user experience. This paper presents Category Highlighting, a technique designed to enhance block discoverability, facilitate intuitive interactions, and improve overall navigation within environments built on the Google Blockly library. We demonstrate its usefulness in different case studies.
