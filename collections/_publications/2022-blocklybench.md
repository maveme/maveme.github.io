abstract: Block-based environments are visual-programming environments that allow users to create programs by dragging and dropping Lego-like blocks. These environments have proven to lower the entry barrier of programming for end-users. Besides using block-based environment for programming, these environments can also help edit popular semi-structured data languages such as JSON and YAML.

However, developing a block-based environment is still challenging; developers can develop them in an ad-hoc way or use context-free grammars in a language workbench. Given the visual nature of block-based languages, both options are valid; however, they have some limitations when describing the languages. In this paper, we present a meta-block-based environment for describing block-based languages for both programming and semi-structured data languages; it allows developers to express the specific elements of both types of block-based languages using blocks. We present three case studies created with Blocklybench to evaluate the proposed solution. Our results show that the block meta-environment allows developers to describe block-based specific aspects of the language constructs such as layout and color.
