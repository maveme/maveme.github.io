Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini have rapidly influenced programming education by providing instant code generation and problem-solving support. 
This study investigates the potential impact of these tools on an introductory Python programming course by conducting an observational analysis of two cohorts in 2022 and 2024.
In total, we analyzed a corpus of 1,614 submissions across three assignments. 
To study the possible influence of generative AI tools, we created baseline solutions for each assignment using ChatGPT and Gemini.

We then analyzed code similarity between the baseline solutions and the students' submissions, as well as syntax errors across both cohorts.
For Assignment 2, peer-to-peer duplication decreased by 60.11\% between 2022 and 2024.
Among the 2024 submissions, we observe substantial similarity to fixed AI baselines, depending on task complexity. Although this pattern is consistent with the convergence toward AI-generated solutions, we lack direct measures of tool use and make no causal claims. 
The number of syntax errors did not differ significantly between the two cohorts.
These findings suggest a shift in programming education, from direct student copying toward solutions that increasingly resemble AI-generated outputs. This shift emphasizes the need for updated assessments and policies to promote fairness, integrity, and meaningful learning in introductory programming courses.
