title: From Data to Play-by-Play - Data-Driven Football Match Narratives
level: Masters CS or AI
authors: Mauricio Verano Merino
type: Graduation project
abstract: This research project focuses on generating natural language descriptions of football gameplay using tracking data. By leveraging player and ball position data, the system will automatically create detailed, context-aware narratives that describe key events during a match, such as passes, tackles, goals, and formations. Using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), the project will translate numerical and spatial data into human-readable text, offering real-time or post-game summaries. The goal is to enhance football analytics by providing intuitive, text-based reports for coaches, analysts, and fans, helping them better understand in-game dynamics and performance.
