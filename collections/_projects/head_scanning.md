title: Eyes on the Game -- Analyzing Head Scanning for Smarter Play in Football
level: Masters CS or AI
authors: Mauricio Verano Merino, Eli Sarasola (Former Professional Football Player)
type: Graduation project
abstract: This research project focuses on analyzing head tracking in real football scenarios to study player scanning behavior before receiving passes. Using video and tracking data, the system will monitor and measure how and when players scan their surroundings prior to receiving the ball, capturing the frequency, timing, and direction of head movements. The project aims to provide insights into how effective scanning improves decision-making and spatial awareness during play. By linking head tracking data with performance metrics, this research seeks to enhance player evaluation, training methodologies, and tactical preparation in football.
