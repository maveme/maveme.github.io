title: Game-Changing Insights -- Advanced Set Piece Visualization for Football Analytics
level: Masters CS or AI
authors: Mauricio Verano Merino, Nicolas Chaves de Plaza (TU Delft)
type: Graduation project
abstract: This research project aims to enhance the visualization and analysis of set pieces in football for advanced analytics. By developing dynamic and interactive visual tools, the system will capture and display key tactical elements of set-piece situations, such as player positioning, movement patterns, and defensive or offensive setups. These visualizations will help analysts and coaches dissect the effectiveness of set pieces, identify trends, and optimize strategies. Integrating tracking data with advanced visual rendering techniques, the project seeks to provide deeper insights into the mechanics and outcomes of set plays, offering a more intuitive and detailed understanding for performance analysis and tactical refinement.
